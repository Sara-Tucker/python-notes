# Views
A view function is a Python function that takes a Web request and returns a Web response. This response can be the HTML contents of a Web page, or a redirect, or a 404 error, or an XML document, or an image, or anything, really. The view itself contains whatever arbitrary logic is necessary to return that response. The convention is to put views in a views.py file.
